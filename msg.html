        <h1>Will you be my Valentine?</h1>
        <h6>To the love of my life, Madhavvv,

            As I sit here trying to find the words to express how much you mean to me, I realize that no words could ever fully capture the depth of my feelings for you. But I’ll try, because you deserve to know just how much you’ve changed my life and how grateful I am to have you in it.
            
            Over the past few months, you’ve become so much more than just my partner. You’ve become my best friend, my safe place, and the person I turn to when the world feels too heavy. Your calm, steady presence is like an anchor for me, especially when my mind feels like a storm and so messed up. You don’t just calm the chaos—you make me feel like I’m home, no matter where we are.
            
            I’m in awe with the way you love me. You love me not just in the easy moments, but in the messy ones too. You see the parts of me that I’m still learning to accept, and instead of turning away, you hold them gently, as if they’re something precious. You’ve shown me what it means to be truly seen and loved for who I am, flaws and all. And for that, I will always be grateful.
            
            I don’t think I’ve ever met someone as kind, patient, and selfless as you. You have this incredible ability to make everything better, just by being you. Whether it’s the way you listen to me ramble about things that don’t even matter, or the way you hold my hand when I’m feeling anxious, you always know exactly what I need. You make me feel like I’m the most important person in the world, and I hope you know that you are that person for me too.
            
            I often think about how lucky I am to have found you. Out of all the people in the world, I get to call you mine.
            
            Thank you for loving me the way you do. Thank you for being my rock, my cheerleader, and my partner in everything. Thank you for the little things—the way you smile at me, the way you make me laugh when I’m taking life too seriously, and the way you remind me that I’m enough, just as I am. You’ve given me a love that feels like peace, and I promise to cherish it for the rest of my life.
            
            I hope you know that no matter what life throws our way, I know we’ll face it together, hand in hand. You’re my person, and I’m so proud to be yours.
            
            your kalesh,
            ananyaaaa
